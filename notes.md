Display MIDI information in a friendly interface with cross-platform compatibility.

We want to display RTP-MIDI data from whatever device.  The tool should have many ways to present this information:
 * On/Off "LEDs"
 * Sliders
 * X-Y areas

MIDI device class to represent RTP-MIDI or Portmidi devices.
MIDI device is backed by a driver which does all the interfacing with those libraries?
